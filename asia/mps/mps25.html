<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="790">790</A></FONT></span>He prayed and said: "Great God of earths and heavens, who sometimes punishest, sometimes art ready to reward, Unknowable and Unspeakable, Lord of lordships, give me to endure longings, O ruler of heart-utterances!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="791">791</A></FONT></span>"God, God, I beseech Thee, who govern&#8217;st the deeps and heights; Thou didst create love, Thou hast decreed its law; Fate has sundered me from mine excellent sun; uproot not the love sowed by her for me!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="792">792</A></FONT></span>"God, God, merciful, I have none beside Thee; from Thee I beg aid on the road, however long I travel; shelter me from the mastery of foes, the turmoil of the seas, the evil one by night! If I survive, I shall serve Thee, I shall offer sacrifice to Thee."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="793">793</A></FONT></span>When he had prayed, he mounted his horse (and) privily passed through the gates; he sent back Shermadin, albeit he made great lamentations. The vassal weeps and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></p>  
<p>beats his breast; the wretched man sheds floods of tears. What can rejoice the vassal deprived of the sight of his lord!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="794">794</A></FONT></span>Now will I begin another tale; I will attend the parting knight. There was no audience that day for the wrathful Rosten. When day dawned he rose sullen; he was as if he poured flame from his face; he commanded the vizier to be called; thither they led him pale with fear.</p>
