</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">XXXVII</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">LETTER WRITTEN BY P&#8217;HATMAN TO NESTAN-DAREDJAN</h3>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1248">1248</A></FONT></span>P&#8217;hatman writes: "O star, heavenly sun of the world, consumer and griever of all them that are afar from thee, elegant and eloquent in words, lovely, fair-tongued, crystal and ruby both welded in one!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1249">1249</A></FONT></span>"Though thou gayest me not to hear thy story, I have learnt the truth, thereby hath my heart been comforted. Console with news Tariel, who is become mad for thee! May you both attain your desire, may he be a rose and thou a violet!</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1250">1250</A></FONT></span>"His sworn brother is come in quest of thee, Avt&#8217;handil, an Arab knight renowned in Arabia, Commander-in-Chief of King Rosten, to be contemned of none. Write news of thyself, thou proud one, wise in understanding!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1251">1251</A></FONT></span>"For this purpose have we sent this slave to your presence: We would know tidings of Kadjet&#8217;hi. Have the Kadjis come home? We wish to know in detail the number of warriors there. Who are thy guards, and who is their chief?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1252">1252</A></FONT></span>"Whatever thou knowest concerning that place, write to us, make it known. Then send some token for thy lover. All the sorrow thou hast had hitherto, change (it) into joy! May it please God that I unite the lovers so befitting each other!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1252a.">1252a.</A></FONT></span>"Go, O letter, hasten, if swift be thy knee! I envy thee, thou goest to see the crystal, jet and rubies. In fate thou art happier than I, O letter; the eyes of her who consumes me will look upon thee. If thou hearest of my life after thee, shalt thou not pity me!"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1253">1253</A></FONT></span>P&#8217;hatman gave the letter to that cunning sorcerer: "Give this letter to the sunlike maiden!" The wizard donned a certain green mantle over his form; in that very moment he was lost to view, he flew over the roofs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1254">1254</A></FONT></span>He went like an arrow shot by a swift-bowed archer. When he reached Kadjet&#8217;hi it was just dusk twilight. Invisible he passed the multitude of knights guarding the gates. He gave to that sun the greeting of her who longed for her.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1255">1255</A></FONT></span>He passed the closed gates of the castle as if they had been open; the negro entered, the black-faced, long-haired,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A></p>  
<p>cloaked; that sun was affrighted, she thought it was somewhat to harm her; the rose was changed to saffron and the violets to sky blue.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1256">1256</A></FONT></span>The Kadj said: "Whom think&#8217;st thou me to be, and why faintest thou thus? I am P&#8217;hatman's slave despatched to thy presence, this letter will justify me, I speak not falsely to thee. Let the sun's rays come forth, O rose, fade not so soon."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1257">1257</A></FONT></span>The sun-faced marvelled at P&#8217;hatman's wonderful news; she split her almonds (opened her eyes), the jets (? black pupils) quivered with the rod of jet (her lashes). The slave gave her the letter with his own hand. She sighs, she reads the letter, she wets it with her hot tears.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1258">1258</A></FONT></span>She asked the slave: "Tell me, who is my seeker, or who knows me to be alive, treading the earth?" He said: "I will venture to tell you only what I know. When thou wentest forth, since then hath our sun been darkened.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1259">1259</A></FONT></span>"Henceforth P&#8217;hatman's heart hath been torn by lances; the tears she shed are (such as) to be united to the seas. Once already I brought news of thee to her. I call God to witness that for her since then the tear hath not ceased.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1260">1260</A></FONT></span>"Now there came a certain knight? fair of face; in detail she told him all, what trouble you are in; he with hero-like arm is thy seeker; they sent me, they entreated me to hasten with ceaseless haste."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1261">1261</A></FONT></span>The maiden said: "What thou hast said, O man, seems to me to be truth. How could P&#8217;hatman know from whom I was carried away! Doubtless somewhere is he who burns me with fire. I will write to her; thou also shalt tell how my heart boils."</p>
