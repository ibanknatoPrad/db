<p><A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">XLV</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE WEDDING OF TARIEL AND NESTAN BY P&#8217;HRIDON</h3>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1439">1439</A></FONT></span>He placed for the maid and the youth a throne white and coral-hued, prettily sprinkled with red and yellow gems; for Avt&#8217;handil one of mingled yellow and black; they came, they sat down. The spectators, I ween, were impatient for them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1440">1440</A></FONT></span>The minstrels came forth; the sound of sweet singing was heard. They made the wedding; the presentation of soft silk stuffs was multiplied by P&#8217;hridon, the good entertainer, not an abashed host. A smile, a tooth-glimpse, beautifies Nestan-Daredjan.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1441">1441</A></FONT></span>They brought out incomparable gifts from the wealthy P&#8217;hridon: nine pearls in size like a goose's egg; also one gem like to the sun with augmented ray; before it at night a painter could have painted a picture.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1442">1442</A></FONT></span>Likewise he presented to each a necklace to throw over the neck, of gems cut into spheres, of whole jacinths. He also brought a tray scarcely to be held in the hand, a gift for the lion Avt&#8217;handil from the generous P&#8217;hridon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1443">1443</A></FONT></span>That tray is full of plump pearls; he gave all to Avt&#8217;handil, with not unseemly words. The house was filled with brocade and soft cloth of gold; Tariel the proud gave thanks with sweet words.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1444">1444</A></FONT></span>For eight days P&#8217;hridon made measureless wedding festivities, every day they offer priceless presents prepared; day and night lute and harp ceased not to sound. Behold a youth and a maiden worthy each of other have attained each other.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1445">1445</A></FONT></span>Tariel one day spake to P&#8217;hridon words of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A></p>  
<p>heart: "Your heart is more mine than that of a complete (<i>i.e.</i>, born) brother; my life would not be a fitting return, nor the gift of my soul; dying I found from you the balm for my wound.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1446">1446</A></FONT></span>"Thou knowest of Avt&#8217;handil's self-sacrifice for my sake; now I would serve him in return; go, ask, he will reveal what he wants; as he hath quenched my furnace, even so hath his burned enough.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1447">1447</A></FONT></span>"Say to him: 'O brother, what will repay thee for the grief thou hast seen for my sake? God will grant thee His grace imaged forth from on high. If I cannot do something desirable for thee, contrived for thy sake, I will not see my house, nor hall, not hut.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1448">1448</A></FONT></span>"'Now tell me what thou wishest of me, or in what I can help thee. I choose that we go to Arabia; be thou my guide. Let us bring to reason the sweet with words, the warlike with swords. If thou be not united to thy wife I will be no husband to mine.'"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1449">1449</A></FONT></span>When P&#8217;hridon told Avt&#8217;handil Taria's message, he laughed, he smiled, mirth beautified him. He said: "Why want I a helper? I am not hurt by a wound from any. The Kadjis possess not my sun, nor doth lack of joy afflict her.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1450">1450</A></FONT></span>"My sun sits upon a throne, powerful by the will of God, respected and honoured, proud, harmed by none, she is by no means oppressed by Kadjis, nor by the sorcery of wizards. Why should I want help with regard to her? Expect me not to speak flattering words.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1451">1451</A></FONT></span>"When Providence shall come for me, heavenly beings from above, (if) God wills, shall visit my heart, consolations for the furnace; then indeed the radiances of the flashing of the sun will be my lot (when I am) dying; till that time be come, vain are my runnings to and fro.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1452">1452</A></FONT></span>"Go and report to Tariel the answer spoken by me: 'What thanks are needed, O king, however great is thy compassion; even from my mother's womb am I born to be your servant, and, by God, let me be but earth till thou be recognized as king.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1453">1453</A></FONT></span>"Thou hast said: 'I desire thy union to thy beloved!' This is like your compassionate heart. There my sword cuts not, nor breadth of tongue. It is better for me to await the deed of yon celestial Providence.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1454">1454</A></FONT></span>"This is my wish and my desire, that I may see thee powerful in India, enthroned upon the thrones, the heavenly light (Nestan), too, sitting by thy side, the face flashing lightning; that your foes be exterminated, that no adversary appear there.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1455">1455</A></FONT></span>"When these the desires of my heart have been fulfilled to me, then indeed shall I go to Arabia, it will befall me to be near that sun; when she wills she shall quench the burnings of this fire for me. Nought else do I wish from you; I hate all kinds of flattery."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1456">1456</A></FONT></span>When P&#8217;hridon reported to Tariel these words of the knight, he said: "That will I not do; for that it needs no wizard. As he found the cause of the existence of my life (Nestan), even so he too shall see the valour of a brother (used) in his favour.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1457">1457</A></FONT></span>"Go, speak on my behalf words not of adulation: I will not remain without seeing thy foster-father. I suspect I slew many servants beloved by him. I will only beg forgiveness, and so I shall return.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1458">1458</A></FONT></span>"Speak thus: 'Send me no more messages. Tomorrow I shall not fail to set out; I shall have no more of the word "if"; the King of the Arabs will not make my words to be of no avail; pleasantly shall I beg his daughter, I shall entreat of him, I shall persuade him."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1459">1459</A></FONT></span>P&#8217;hridon told Avt&#8217;handil Taria's message: "He</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_238"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 238</FONT></A></p>  
<p>will not stay," quoth he; "vain is it for thee to speak of waiting!" It oppressed him; again the smoke and glow burned his heart. Thus respect is due to kings, devotion from knights.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1460">1460</A></FONT></span>Avt&#8217;handil went to beseech Taria on bonded knee; he embraces his feet, he kisses them, he no longer looks up to his waist. He says: "What I have sinned against Rosten this year is enough; make me not again to be a breaker, a shatterer of loyalty.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1461">1461</A></FONT></span>"What thou desirest God's justice will not give thee. How can I dare do a treacherous deed to my foster-father, how can I undertake aught against him who for my sake is become pale, how can the servant use his sword upon his master!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1462">1462</A></FONT></span>"Such a deed will make discord between me and my beloved. Woe is me if she become angry, displeased, if wrath compel her heart! (Then) will she even stint me of tidings, and make me languish for a sight of her. No man of flesh can exact forgiveness for me."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1463">1463</A></FONT></span>Tariel, that radiant sun, spake laughing. He took Avt&#8217;handil's hand, raised him, set him on his feet: "Thy help hath done me every good, but it is better that thou also shouldst rejoice my joy with thine.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1464">1464</A></FONT></span>"I greatly hate too much fear, respect and ceremony in a friend, I hate unbroken sternness, gloominess, majesty; if one be a hearty friend let him tend towards me; if not, I for myself, he for himself, separation is much better.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1465">1465</A></FONT></span>"I know the heart of thy beloved with regard to thee; the visit of me who have met thee will not displease her. Now I can venture to speak somewhat plausibly to the king: I only desire to see the desirable sight of them.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1466">1466</A></FONT></span>"This only will I say to him entreatingly and respectfully: that he should give thee his daughter of his free will. Since the end is union, how can you endure separation? Beautify each other; fade not apart."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1467">1467</A></FONT></span>When Avt&#8217;handil knew from Taria that he would not be hindered from going, he ventured not to dispute, he added thereto assent. P&#8217;hridon counted over select men as a convoy; he set out with them, of course he travelled the road with them.</p>
