</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">XL</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">AVT&#8217;HANDIL'S LETTER TO P&#8217;HRIDON</h3>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1294">1294</A></FONT></span>He wrote: "Exalted P&#8217;hridon, supremely blest, king of kings, lion-like in stout-heartedness, O sun, recklessly shedding rays, mighty, joyous, spiller of the blood of foes--thy youngest brother from far, far away barks thee a greeting.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1295">1295</A></FONT></span>"I have seen troubles, and I have, too, received recompense for what pains I have suffered. Well hath fallen out the matter planned by me: I have truly learned the story of that face likened to a sun, the sustainer of that lion who was buried under the earth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1296">1296</A></FONT></span>"The sovereign of the Kadjis has that sun; she is captive in Kadjet&#8217;hi. To go thither seems to me sport,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A></p>  
<p>though the road is one of battle. From the narcissi a rain of crystal falls; the rose is wet with rain. The Kadjis are not yet with the maid, but countless is their host.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1297">1297</A></FONT></span>"Glad in heart I rejoice, for this my tear will not flow in channels. Wherever thou and thy brother (Tariel) are the difficult will be made easy; whatever you may desire you will certainly do it, you shall not fail; not only no man can stand against you, I trow that even a rock will soften before you.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1298">1298</A></FONT></span>"Now pardon me, I cannot see thee, so I have passed afar off; I have no leisure to linger on the road, for that moon is captive. Soon shall we come merry; rejoice at the sight of us! What more than this can I say to thee: help thy brother in brotherly fashion?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1299">1299</A></FONT></span>"The attachment of these slaves is beyond reward; pleasantly have they served me, and your heart, too, will be pleased at this. Why should he be praised who hath sojourned long with you? Every like gives birth to like; this is a saying of the sages."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1300">1300</A></FONT></span>He wrote this letter, he tied it up and rolled its; the rose, the violet-haired, gave it to P&#8217;hridon's slaves; he communicated through them by word of mouth all that was needful, how he should do; the open door of coral showed its pearls to them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1301">1301</A></FONT></span>Avt&#8217;handil searched; he found a ship of that region (where Tariel was). That sun with the face of a full moon prepared to set out; but to leave the woeful-hearted P&#8217;hatman was a heaviness to him; those who parted from him shed a rivulet of blood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1302">1302</A></FONT></span>P&#8217;hatman, Usen and the slaves weep with hot tears. They said: "O sun, what hast thou done to us? Thou didst burn us with hot fires, why darkenest thou us</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with the gloom of thine absence? Bury us with thy hands which have (already) buried us! (<i>i.e.</i>, by thy departure)."</p>
