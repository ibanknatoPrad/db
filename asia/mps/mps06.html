</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">III</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">AVT&#8217;HANDIL'S LETTER TO HIS VASSALS</h3>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="164">164</A></FONT></span> He wrote as follows: "My vassals, my instructors and some my pupils, faithful, trusty and tried, attentive to my behests like shadows, hearken to my letter all assembled!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="165">165</A></FONT></span> "Give ear! I, Avt&#8217;handil, earth beneath your feet, write this unto you; with mine own hand have I written this epistle. For a little while I have preferred roaming to drink and song; for bread and meat I shall trust to my bow and thumb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="166">166</A></FONT></span> "I have in hand a certain matter which makes me journey to a far country; I depart alone, and this year shall I travel. I ask you only this: I beseech you let me find the realm unshaken by the foe.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="167">167</A></FONT></span> "I have appointed Shermadin to be lord in my stead; until he learn of my life or death he will shine upon you all like the sun; he will make the rose to be frosted and not fade, he will cause all misdoers to melt away like wax.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="168">168</A></FONT></span> You know, too, how he has grown up with me like a brother and like a son; you must obey him as if he were Avt&#8217;handil; let him make to sound the trumpet, do everything as I have hitherto done; if I come not at the time appointed, mourning and not laughter will be seemly, to you."</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="169">169</A></FONT></span> The eloquent and nice-worded one ended this letter, he tied gold round his waist, habited himself to travel alone; he said: "I shall mount in the plain." The soldiers formed in line, then they came forth; he tarried no time indoors.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="170">170</A></FONT></span> He said: "Let all go hence; herein I need none as a partisan." He sent the slaves away also, he remained by himself, alone he withdrew himself, he hastened through the rushes. His slayer, T&#8217;hinat&#8217;hin, is always in his thoughts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="171">171</A></FONT></span> He galloped over that plain; he was lost to the soldiers&#8217; sight. Whatever human being might have seen him and pursued him, his sword could not harm him; his arm was hampered. He was heavy laden with a burden of grief for her sake.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="172">172</A></FONT></span> When the soldiers hunted and sought their lord, and could no longer find the sun-faced, their countenances paled, their great joy turned into heaviness, they ran everywhere to seek him, whoever had a swift horse,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="173">173</A></FONT></span> O lion, whom can God put in thy place! They ran and brought out other messengers from elsewhere; they could learn nothing of him; he passed from that place. His disheartened hosts shed hot tears.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="174">174</A></FONT></span> Shermadin assembled together the courtiers and nobles; he showed them the letter in which he (Avt&#8217;handil) had told them his tidings. When they heard it, all remained heart-pierced, they beat themselves, there was not a tearless heart, not an unbruised breast.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="175">175</A></FONT></span> All said: "Though our state without him is irksome to us, to whom save thee could he give his seat and throne? Of a truth we shall obey thee, whatever thou commandest any of us." They made that vassal lord; all did him homage.</p>
