The sunbeam wrote: 'O lion! let not thy wound appear. I am thine. Die not, but I hate vain fainting. Now Asmat&#8217;h tells thee all that is spoken by me.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="364">364</A></FONT></span>"'Pitiful fainting and dying, what love dost thou think this! It is better to exhibit to the beloved deeds of heroism. All dwellers in Khatavet&#8217;hi are our tributaries; now their ill-will towards us cannot be borne by us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="365">365</A></FONT></span>"'I was desirous to wed thee even before, but hitherto I have not found opportunity to speak. The other day I saw thee deprived of reason sitting in the litter; then I heard all that had befallen thee.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="366">366</A></FONT></span>"'I will tell thee truth; hearken to this that I say to thee: Go, do battle with the Khatavians, exhibit thyself to me in a goodly manner, this is better for thee. Weep idly no more; why moisten more the rose! What more can the sun do to thee! Behold, I have turned thy darkness to dawn.'</p>
