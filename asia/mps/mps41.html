<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1262">1262</A></FONT></span>"I, the sun-faced, write: O dame, O mother, better than a mother to me! See what the world (Fate) hath done to me its thrall! Alas! there is added to those griefs of mine still another! Now that I have seen thy missive it hath greatly encouraged me.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1263">1263</A></FONT></span>"Thou didst save me from two sorcerers; thou didst alleviate my woes. Now I am thus held here by the whole force of the Kadjis; a whole realm, many thousand heroes, guard me alone. Ill befell my counsels and resolves (to flee from P&#8217;hatman).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1264">1264</A></FONT></span>"What other tidings hence can I write to thee? The king (<i>i.e.</i>, queen) of the Kadjis is not come, nor will the Kadjis yet come; but countless hosts guard me, and with what bravery! (?) What! the quest for me! It is not possible, believe me!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1265">1265</A></FONT></span>"Whoever is come seeking me is wearied in vain he suffers, he is consumed, he is kindled for me, a flame like fire burns him. But I envy him, he hath seen the sun, thus is he not frozen. Without him, alas! what great pity my life is</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1266">1266</A></FONT></span>"Formerly I told thee not my story, I hid it from thee for that my tongue could not speak it; I spared myself woes. I entreat thee, beg my beloved to have pity and not come in search of me, write to him, send him a message.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1267">1267</A></FONT></span>"What afflicts me is enough, let him not slay me with (a woe) equal to this: I should see him a corpse, I should die a double death. None can help me, I know this for a truth; this is no gossip. If he (Tariel) will</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A></p>  
<p>not hearken to thee, stone me with a heap of black stone!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1268">1268</A></FONT></span>"Thou didst ask me to send a token, show this: I send a cutting from the veils he gave me; these (veils) for his sake are a fair sight to me, though in colour they are black, like my fate."</p>
