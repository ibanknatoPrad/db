<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="367">367</A></FONT></span>"With mine eyes I gazed upon the letter written by her. I wrote in answer: 'O moon, how indeed can the sun surpass thee! May God not give me that which is not like thee! I feel as in a dream; I cannot believe in my survival.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="368">368</A></FONT></span>"I said to Asmat&#8217;h: 'I cannot devise more answer than this. Say thus to her: O sun! since thou art arisen as a light for me, behold thou hast quickened me (who was) dead; I shall faint no more henceforth, whatever be the service I am a liar if I shun it.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="369">369</A></FONT></span>"Asmat&#8217;h said to me: 'She told me: Let us do thus, thus were it better: Whoever sees thee will discover nothing of my discourse with him; he will come to see me as if he were making love to thee. She entreated me to tell the Amirbar so to behave.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="370">370</A></FONT></span>"This counsel pleased me, the wisdom of the heart of her whom even the sun took care not to gaze on; she had given to me to hear the refined d conversation of her in whose rays daylight was like darkness.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="371">371</A></FONT></span>"I gave Asmat&#8217;h choice jewels with a golden cup. She said to me: 'No. I do not want them; I have these to satiety.' She took one ring weighing a drachmas; 'this is enough for a token; I am full of other bracelets.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="372">372</A></FONT></span>"The maid arose and went forth. The spears spared my heart, joy lightened my darkness, the fire which had burned me was extinguished. I went in and sat down at the banquet where my comrades were drinking; joyful, I distributed gifts, the jubilation increased.</p>
